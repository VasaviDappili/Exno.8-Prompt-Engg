# Aim: To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
# Algorithm: Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate audio content (e.g., music, sound effects, voice narration) using AI model.

# AI-Tool Required:
## Suno AI (https://suno.com/)

# 🎧 PROMPTING TECHNIQUES USED
## 🔵 Audio 1:
```
"Create a cinematic ambient track that begins with soft rainfall and a gentle breeze layered behind an emotional solo piano. The piano should follow a slow, melancholic melody. As the track progresses, slowly introduce distant thunder rumbles. At the midpoint, add a single loud thunderclap for dramatic tension. Afterward, let the piano gradually slow down and fade, leaving only the ambient rain and breeze as the track ends."
```

# 🟢 Audio 2:
```
“A lone astronaut drifts through the dark silence of space, with only the hum of life support echoing inside the helmet. In the distance, a mysterious alien signal pulses—a rhythmic sound, growing louder. Suddenly, static interferes, and an ominous voice whispers coordinates… then silence.”

# 🎼 Waveform Analysis

| Feature               | Ghost Theme (1.mp3)            | Sci-Fi Suspense (2.mp3)             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Mood**              | Eerie, slow, mysterious        | Futuristic, suspenseful, dark       |
| **Amplitude Pattern** | Wavy, minor spikes at whispers | Starts flat, spikes at static burst |
| **Instrumentation**   | Piano, violin, whispers, wind  | Synth, static, bass pulse           |
| **Rhythm**            | Waltz-like, 3/4 beat           | Irregular, sci-fi ambient pacing    |
| **Atmosphere**        | Haunted graveyard at night     | Outer space with alien encounter    |

# 📊 Frequency Spectrum Analysis

| Metric                   | Ghost Theme                        | Sci-Fi Suspense                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Dominant Frequencies** | Mid-high (piano, whispers)         | Low-mid (synth, static)        |
| **Bass Content**         | Light bass (wind, cello undertone) | Strong bass during signal drop |
| **Tonal Range**          | Warm to cold, eerie intervals      | Wide dynamic contrast          |
| **Dynamic Shifts**       | Soft → whisper → sudden silence    | Calm → static burst → silence  |

# 🧠 Technical Comparison Summary

| Feature                   | Ghost Theme (1.mp3)               | Sci-Fi Suspense (2.mp3)          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Narrative Flow**        | Cyclical: eerie → silence → eerie | Linear: space → signal → silence |
| **Instrumentation Focus** | Classical + ambient               | Electronic + sci-fi elements     |
| **Best Use Case**         | Haunted storytelling              | Space-themed games/videos        |

# 📝 Suggestions
## ✅ Use Audio 1 (Ghost Theme) for:
